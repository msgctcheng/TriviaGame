* This trivia game was one of my early projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.  I chose the theme because Ive always been a fan of Jeopardy.

* The game is a single round of multiple choice questions, using `radio` buttons for answer choices.

* The player has 20 seconds to answer each question and the answer is checked upon pressing the "Submit" button.

* Each question is worth a certain number of points, with the same rules as Jeopardy, and the game keeps track of the player's score.  It also keeps track of the number of wrong and right answers.
